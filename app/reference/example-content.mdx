This is a **reference sheet** to _demonstrate_ and _showcase_ what can be accomplished using base markdown and my custom mdx components. The left panel is the raw mdx that you write, and the right panel is a preview of what would be actually displayed.

# Standard Markdown

This are the _base features_ of markdown (along with some HTML tags). Please take a look even if you are familiar, since a lot of the components are **customly styled for this project**.

## Headings

Each of the headings **shrink in size and change colors** to help distinguish them. The colors chosen are different for light and dark mode. The colors are meant to match the "space" theme of the project.

---

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

####### Heading 7

---

## Standard Text

This is a standard paragraph with **bold text**, _italic text_, and `inline code`. It also supports **_bolded italics_**, <del>strikethrough</del>, and <mark>highlights</mark> (using HTML tags).

---

## Lists

Lists are kept nearly the same as original markdown.

### Unordered Lists

- Unordered **list item**
- Another item
  - _Nested_ item
- Some other item

### Ordered Lists

1. Ordered list **item**
2. Second item
   - Unordered list item nested _within_ ordered list item
3. Third item

## Code Blocks

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, Constellation!");
}
```

## Math (LaTeX)

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

Block math:

$$
\\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^2 dx
$$

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.

# Custom MDX Components

These are custom components made by me. More will be made in the future, and changes to existing components are possible. These components are made by using tags.

## Alerts

Shows different levels of importance. Can be done using the `type` of the `Alert` component, or use a level directly.

<Alert>This is a standard alert that defaults to info</Alert>

---

<Alert type=info>This is an "info" level alert achieved using the alert type</Alert>
<Info>This is an "info" level alert achieved using the direct "Info" component</Info>

---

<Alert type=warning>This is a warning</Alert>
<Warning>This is also a warning</Warning>

---

<Alert type=issue>THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE</Alert>
<Issue>A SECOND MAJOR ISSUE</Issue>
